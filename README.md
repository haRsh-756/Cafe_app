# Inspiration
Reduce the environmental impact of trips, vacations, and travel, which are some of the most fun things to do for people.

# What it does
Plans a trip for the user so that it has the least impact on the environment.

# How we built it
We started by creating wireframes and mockups of the user interface. Then we began developing the frontend using React, writing code for the various UI components, and using React Router for navigation. Once the frontend was built, we integrated the Google Maps API into the backend. We used the OpenAI API to create the best trip with the least environmental impact. We used Git to track changes and collaborate on code.

# Challenges we ran into
It was very difficult for us to combine the Google Maps API with React version 18, as there were very few resources on the internet explaining how to do this.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built a full-stack web app by integrating two entirely different APIs. We are also very proud of integrating the Google Maps API with React version 18.

# What we learned
We learnt how to integrate two very complicated APIs while building a full-stack web app at the same time.

# What's next for Green Routes
We will likely add machine learning models to predict real-time traffic. We will also create a mobile app so it is more accessible to users. we also plan to integrate better GPT models into our app as they get better over time.
