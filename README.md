# Inspiration
CS213-Software Methodology last project. Built an RU_CAFE application using Android Studio-Java(Android App) and JavaFX(Desktop App).
 
# What it does
Task was to develop a software with JavaFX and Android studio to help the RU Café which manages the orders. The store manager will be
the user who uses the software to take the orders, place the orders and cancel the orders. The menu items available in
the Café includes donuts and coffee.
There are 3 types of donuts: yeast donuts, cake donuts and donut holes. Each type of donuts includes a variety of
flavors. Regardless of the flavors, a yeast donut is $1.59, a cake donut is $1.79, and a donut hole is $0.39.
The Café sells brewed coffee only. Customers have choices of add-ins, including sweet cream, French vanilla, Irish
cream, caramel, and mocha. Each add-in costs $0.30. There are different cup sizes for the coffee: Short, Tall, Grande
and Venti. The base price for a Short black coffee is $1.89. The price increases $0.40 for the next cup size. For
example, a Tall black coffee would be $2.29, and a Grande black coffee would be $2.69. A Short coffee with 2 add-
ins would be $2.49.

# How we built it
We started by creating navigation design of views/activities of the user interface. Then we began developing the frontend using SceneBuilder(desktop app) and XML(Android app), writing code for the various UI components, and using buttons for navigation. Once the frontend was built, we integrated the controllers for each activity/view into the backend to handle the action events. We used necessary tools to create the best user-freindly app. We used Github to track changes and collaborate on code.

# Challenges we ran into
Android app: It was difficult for us to find how to highlight the selected item in a list view and remove selected item.
Desktop app: It was difficult for us to how to remove the selected item in a list view and update the final list also it was time consuming to figure out how to export placed orders to a text file using Serialization.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built a web app and android app by integrating two entirely different frameworks/tools. We are also very proud of achieving stable and as expected performance of both apps.

# What we learned
We learnt how to use two very complicated frameworks/tools while building a web app and android app at the same time.

# What's next for RU_CAFE
We will likely add database technologies. We will also publish finalized app to Google Play Store so it is more accessible to users.
