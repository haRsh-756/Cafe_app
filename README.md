Your team will develop a software with JavaFX and with android studio to help the RU Café manages the orders. The store manager will be the user who uses the software to take the orders, place the orders and cancel the orders. The menu items available in the Café includes donuts and coffee.
There are 3 types of donuts: yeast donuts, cake donuts and donut holes. Each type of donuts includes a variety of flavors. Regardless of the flavors, a yeast donut is $1.59, a cake donut is $1.79, and a donut hole is $0.39. The Café sells brewed coffee only. Customers have choices of add-ins, including sweet cream, French vanilla, Irish cream, caramel, and mocha. Each add-in costs $0.30. There are different cup sizes for the coffee: Short, Tall, Grande and Venti. The base price for a Short black coffee is $1.89. The price increases $0.40 for the next cup size. For example, a Tall black coffee would be $2.29, and a Grande black coffee would be $2.69. A Short coffee with 2 add-ins would be $2.49.
